      If necessary, register Inferno as a standalone application using the following information:

      * Redirect URI: `#{REDIRECT_URI}`

      Once the test is running, Inferno will perform a launch.  The tester must grant
      a sub-resource scope for each Condition and Observation, instead of granting
      access to all Condition and Observation resources:

      * “Condition” sub-resource scopes “Encounter Diagnosis”, “Problem List”,
          and “Health Concern”
      * “Observation” sub-resource scopes “Clinical Test”, “Laboratory”,
          “Social History”, “SDOH”, “Survey”, and “Vital Signs”

      Additionally, please grant access to the Patient scope.

    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      This scenario verifies that when resource-level scopes are requested for
      Condition and Observation resources, the user is presented with the option
      of granting sub-resource scopes instead of the requested resource-level scope if desired.

      This scenario verifies that system behavior is consistent with the
      following clarification provided in the §170.315(g)(10) Standardized API
      for patient and population services [Certification Companion
      Guide](https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#ccg):

      > As part of supporting the SMART App Launch “permission-v2” capability
        for the purposes of certification, if an app requests authorization for
        a resource level scope for the “Condition” or “Observation” resources,
        then for patient authorization purposes a Health IT Module must support
        presentation of the required sub-resource scopes to the patient for
        authorization. Specifically, sub-resource scopes must be presented for
        patient authorization as follows:

      > * “Condition” sub-resource scopes “Encounter Diagnosis”, “Problem List”,
          and “Health Concern” if a “Condition” resource level scope is
          requested
      > * “Observation” sub-resource scopes “Clinical Test”, “Laboratory”,
          “Social History”, “SDOH”, “Survey”, and “Vital Signs” if an
          “Observation” resource level scope is requested

      The tests request SMART App Launch v2 resource-level Condition and
      Observation scopes. In each instance, the user must not grant the
      resource-level scopes and instead grant any valid sub-resource scope for
      Condition and Observation listed above. This scenario also requires that a
      resource-level Patient scope be granted.

      This scenario only verifies that sub-resource scopes are granted as returned by the
      authorization system during the SMART App Launch process, and does not
      attempt to access resources to verify accuracy of the granted scopes.
