      Register Inferno as a standalone application using the following information:

      * Redirect URI: `#{REDIRECT_URI}`

      Enter in the appropriate scope to enable patient-level access to all
      relevant resources. If using SMART v2, v2-style scopes must be used. In
      addition, support for the OpenID Connect (openid fhirUser), refresh tokens
      (offline_access), and patient context (launch/patient) are required.
    )
    description %(

      This scenario verifies the ability of systems to support public clients
      as described in the SMART App Launch implementation specification.  Previous
      scenarios have not required the system under test to demonstrate this
      specific type of SMART App Launch client.

      Prior to executing this test, register Inferno as a public standalone
      application using the following information:

      * Redirect URI: `#{REDIRECT_URI}`

      Inferno will act as a public client redirect the tester to the the
      authorization endpoint so that they may provide any required credentials
      and authorize the application. Upon successful authorization, Inferno will
      exchange the authorization code provided for an access token.
