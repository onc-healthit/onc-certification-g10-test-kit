      Inferno may be registered multiple times with different `client_ids`, or this
      may reuse a single registration of Inferno.`

      This test will perform two launches, with each launch requiring a separate

    description <<~DESCRIPTION

      As finalized in the [HTI-1 Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-28857/p-1250), Health IT Modules are
      required to support SMART App Launch v2.0.0 "Finer-grained resource
      constraints using search parameters" for the "category" parameter for the
      Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem
      List, and Health Concern, and the Observation resource with Observation
      sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and
      Vital Signs.

      This is also reflected in the (g)(10) Standardized API for patient and
      populations [Test
      Procedure](https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/standardized-api-patient-and-population-services#test_procedure):

      > [AUT-PAT-28] SMART v2 scope syntax for patient-level and user-level scopes to support
        the “permission-v2” “SMART on FHIR® Capability”, including support for
        finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters according to
        section 3.0.2.3 of the implementation specification at § 170.215(c)(2) for
        the “category” parameter for the following resources: (1) Condition
        resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List,
        and Health Concern; and (2) Observation resource with Observation
        sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and
        Vital Signs

      Prior to running this scenario, first run the Single Patient API tests using
      resource-level scopes, as this scenario uses content saved from that scenario
      as a baseline for comparison when finer-grained scopes are granted.

      This scenario contains two groups of finer-grained scope tests, each of
      which includes a SMART Standalone Launch that requests a subset of
      finer-grained scopes, followed by FHIR API requests to verify that scopes
      are appropriately granted. The app launches require that the subset of the
      requested finer-grained scopes are granted by the user. The FHIR API tests then repeat all
      of the queries from the original Single Patient API tests that were run
      using resource-level scopes, and verify that only resources matching the
      current finer-grained scopes are returned. Each group requires a separate
      set of finer-grained scopes to be granted:

      Group 1:
      * `Condition.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-category|encounter-diagnosis`
      * `Condition.rs?category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/condition-category|health-concern`
      * `Observation.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category|laboratory`
      * `Observation.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category|social-history`

      Group 2:
      * `Condition.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-category|problem-list-item`
      * `Observation.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category|vital-signs`
      * `Observation.rs?category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category|survey`
      * `Observation.rs?category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/us-core-category|sdoh`

      Note that Inferno will only request the finer grained scopes in each case,
      but the system under test can display more scopes to the tester during
      authorization.  In this case, it is expected that the tester will only
      approve the appropriate scopes in each group as described above.
