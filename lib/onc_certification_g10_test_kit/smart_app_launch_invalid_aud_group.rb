      Register Inferno as a standalone application using the following information:

      * Redirect URI: `#{REDIRECT_URI}`
    )
    description %(
      This scenario verifies that a SMART Launch Sequence, specifically the
      Standalone Launch Sequence, does not succeed in the case where the client
      sends an invalid FHIR server as the `aud` parameter during launch. This
      must fail to ensure that a genuine bearer token is not leaked to a
      counterfit resource server.

      This test is not included in earlier scenarios because it requires the
      browser of the user to be redirected to the authorization service, and
      there is no expectation that the authorization service redirects the user
      back to Inferno with an error message. The only requirement is that
      Inferno is not granted a code to exchange for a valid access token. Since
      this is a special case, it is tested independently in a separate sequence.

      Note that this test will launch a new browser window. The user is required
      to 'Attest' in the Inferno user interface after the launch does not
      succeed, if the server does not return an error code.

      The following implementation specifications are relevant to this scenario:
