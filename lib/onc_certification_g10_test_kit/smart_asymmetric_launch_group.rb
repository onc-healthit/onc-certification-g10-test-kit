    title 'Asymmetric Client Standalone Launch'
    short_title 'Asymmetric Client Launch'
    description %(
      The [Standalone
      Launch Sequence](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/app-launch.html#launch-app-standalone-launch)
      allows an app, like Inferno, to be launched independent of an
      existing EHR session. It is one of the two launch methods described in
      the SMART App Launch Framework alongside EHR Launch. The app will
      request authorization for the provided scope from the authorization
      endpoint, ultimately receiving an authorization token which can be used
      to gain access to resources on the FHIR server.

      These tests specifically verify a system's support for [confidential
      asymmetric client
      authentication](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/client-confidential-asymmetric.html),
      which is not verified in earlier scenarios.

      In this scenario, Inferno will redirect the user to the the authorization endpoint so that
      they may provide any required credentials and authorize the application.
      Upon successful authorization, Inferno will exchange the authorization
      code provided for an access token.

      * [Standalone Launch Sequence](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/app-launch.html#launch-app-standalone-launch)
    )

    input_instructions %(
      Register Inferno as a standalone application using the following information:

      * Redirect URI: `#{REDIRECT_URI}`
      * JWKS URI (`jku`): `#{Inferno::Application[:base_url]}/custom/smart_stu2/.well-known/jwks.json`

      Enter in the appropriate scopes to enable access to the Patient resource.
      In addition, support for the OpenID Connect (openid fhirUser), refresh
      tokens (offline_access), and patient context (launch/patient) are
      required.
