    input_instructions %(
      The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that users can restrict access
      granted to apps to a limited number of resources. Enter which resources the
      user will grant access to below, and during the launch process only grant
      access to those resources. Inferno will verify that access granted matches
      these expectations.

      This scenario demonstrates the ability to perform a Patient Standalone
      Launch to a [SMART on FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/)
      confidential client with limited access granted to the app based on user
      input. The tester is expected to grant the application access to a subset
      of desired resource types.  The launch is performed using the same app
      configuration as in the Standalone Patient App test, demonstrating that
      the user is control over what scopes are granted to the app as required in
      the (g)(10) Standardized API criterion.

        # Background

        The [Standalone
        Launch Sequence](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/index.html#standalone-launch-sequence)
        allows an app, like Inferno, to be launched independent of an
        existing EHR session. It is one of the two launch methods described in
        the SMART App Launch Framework alongside EHR Launch. The app will
        request authorization for the provided scope(s) from the authorization
        endpoint, and the user of the app will choose to either grant
        the app access to the requested scope(s), or to deny one or all of the requested
        scope(s).

        This test verifies the ability of a server to provide a user
        with the choice of which scopes to grant an app.  Allowing users to choose
        which resource types to grant access to is a requirement of the ONC
        (g)(10) certification criteria.  Prior to the test, the tester specifies
        which resource types will be granted, and then during the authorization
        process the tester grants access to those scopes.

        # Test Methodology

        Inferno will redirect the user to the authorization endpoint so that
        they may provide any required credentials and authorize the application.
        Upon successful authorization, Inferno will exchange the authorization
        code provided for an access token. Inferno verifies that the server only
        grants access to the resources specified by the user.
