      The purpose of this test is to verify that patient app users can restrict
      access granted to apps to a limited number of resources. This test can
      only be run after the Standalone Patient App test, and all other inputs
      are locked to ensure the same launch configuration in both tests.

      Enter which resources the user will grant access to below, and during the
      launch process only grant access to those resources. Inferno will verify
      that access granted matches these expectations.

    description %(
      This scenario verifies the ability of a system to perform a Patient Standalone
      Launch to a SMART on FHIR confidential client with limited access granted
      to the app based on user input. The tester is expected to grant the
      application access to a subset of desired resource types. The launch is
      performed using the same app configuration as in the Standalone Patient
      App test, demonstrating that the user has control over what scopes are
      granted to the app as required in the (g)(10) Standardized API criterion.

      The following implementation specifications are relevant to this scenario:

      * [SMART on FHIR
        (STU1)](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/)
      * [SMART on FHIR

        # Background

        The [Standalone
        Launch Sequence](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/index.html#standalone-launch-sequence)
        allows an app, like Inferno, to be launched independent of an
        existing EHR session. It is one of the two launch methods described in
        the SMART App Launch Framework alongside EHR Launch. The app will
        request authorization for the provided scope(s) from the authorization
        endpoint, and the user of the app will choose to either grant
        the app access to the requested scope(s), or to deny one or all of the requested
        scope(s).

        This test verifies the ability of a server to provide a user
        with the choice of which scopes to grant an app.  Allowing users to choose
        which resource types to grant access to is a requirement of the ONC
        (g)(10) certification criteria.  Prior to the test, the tester specifies
        which resource types will be granted, and then during the authorization
        process the tester grants access to those scopes.

        # Test Methodology

        Inferno will redirect the user to the authorization endpoint so that
        they may provide any required credentials and authorize the application.
        Upon successful authorization, Inferno will exchange the authorization
        code provided for an access token. Inferno verifies that the server only
        grants access to the resources specified by the user.
