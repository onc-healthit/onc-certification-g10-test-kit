    title 'Bulk Data Authorization'
    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      Bulk Data servers are required to authorize clients using the
      [Backend Service Authorization](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/authorization/)
      specification as defined in the [FHIR Bulk Data Authorization Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/).

      In this set of tests, Inferno serves as a Bulk Data client that attempts to authorize
      to the Bulk Data authorization server.  It also performs a number of negative tests
      to validate that the authorization service does not improperly authorize invalid
      requests.

      This test returns an access token.
